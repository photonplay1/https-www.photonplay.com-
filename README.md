Electronic traffic signal devices are electronic systems that control the flow of traffic at intersections. These devices use sensors, cameras, and computer algorithms to detect the presence and movement of vehicles and pedestrians, and adjust the timing of traffic signals accordingly. Electronic traffic signal devices can improve traffic flow, reduce congestion and accidents, and make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Some examples of electronic traffic signal devices include adaptive traffic control systems, intelligent transportation systems, and connected vehicle technologies.
